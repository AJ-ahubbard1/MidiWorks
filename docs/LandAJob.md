- Command pattern for undo/redo
- Real-time constraints (10ms timer, MIDI callback)
- Multi-threaded architecture (RtMidi callback + main loop)

**"How do you handle real-time timing requirements?"**
- 10ms update timer in MainFrame
- RtMidi callback on separate thread
- Thread-safe queue for MIDI input
- State management in main thread

**"Tell me about a hard bug you debugged"**

> C++ systems. I built MidiWorks, a complete MIDI sequencer with real-time processing,
> multi-track recording, and hardware integration. My background gives me strong
> problem-solving and communication skills, and I'm passionate about applying my
> C++ knowledge to [embedded systems / audio software / defense technology].
> I'm looking for a role where I can contribute to challenging technical problems
> and grow as an engineer."

**"Why do you want to work here?"**
- Research the company specifically

## MINDSET & MOTIVATION

### Remember:
- ✅ You ARE qualified (CS degree + MidiWorks)
- ✅ You ARE hireable (mid-level capable)
- ✅ You WILL get rejected (it's a numbers game)
- ✅ You only need ONE company to say yes

### When You Feel Imposter Syndrome:
1. Re-read the "You ARE good enough" conversation
2. Look at MidiWorks - you BUILT this
3. Remember: CS degree + portfolio = top 5% of candidates
4. Using AI is smart, not cheating
5. Age/experience gaps are NOT dealbreakers

### When You Get Rejected:
1. It's not about your skill level
2. Most rejections are:
   - Timing (they found someone else)
   - Fit (not your fault)
   - Numbers (they can't hire everyone)
3. Apply to 10 more jobs
4. Keep going

### Daily Affirmations (If You Need Them):
- "I ship working software"
- "I solve hard problems"
- "I am learning and improving"
- "One company will say yes"
- "I am a software engineer"
