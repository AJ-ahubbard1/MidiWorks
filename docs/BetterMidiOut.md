Recommended: FluidSynth + SoundFonts

FluidSynth is the go-to open-source software synthesizer:
- Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)
		- Uses SoundFont 2 (.sf2) format
		- Actively maintained, very stable
		- Can be integrated into apps or used standalone

		Windows: VirtualMIDISynth (Easiest)

		https://coolsoft.altervista.org/en/virtualmidisynth
		- Based on FluidSynth
- Installs as a Windows MIDI device (shows up in your device list automatically)
		- GUI for managing SoundFonts
		- Just install it, load a SoundFont, and select it in MidiWorks!

High-Quality SoundFonts (Free)

		Once you have FluidSynth/VirtualMIDISynth, load one of these:

1. GeneralUser GS ⭐ (Recommended)
		- http://schristiancollins.com/generaluser.php
		- php30 MB, excellent quality
- Full GM/GS compatible (128+ instruments)
		- Way better than Microsoft GS
		2. MuseScore_General.sf2
		- https://github.com/musescore/MuseScore/tree/master/share/sound
		- Used by MuseScore notation software
		- Very good quality, quality35 MB
		3. FluidR3_GM.sf2
		- Default FluidSynth SoundFont
		- Decent quality, quality140 MB
		- Good starting point
4. Timbres of Heaven (Large but excellent)
		- excellent500 MB, studio-quality samples
		- Best free option if you have disk space

		Quick Setup

1. Install VirtualMIDISynth (Windows) or FluidSynth (cross-platform)
		2. Download GeneralUser GS SoundFont
		3. Load it in VirtualMIDISynth settings
		4. In MidiWorks, select "VirtualMIDISynth #1" as output device

		The difference is night and day - Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth is notoriously low-quality compared to modern SoundFonts.
